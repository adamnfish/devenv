# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Consult `SPEC.md` to understand what we're building - a CLI tool for managing ephemeral, branch-scoped Dev Container environments.

## Development Workflow

- Follow the implementation plan in `TODO.md`
- When you complete a feature, notify the user so they can review it
- Wait for user approval before updating `TODO.md` with progress or new tasks
- Update `TODO.md` at the end of every completed feature to track progress
